This Project was a completion of course work (Mechanical Technician Course, by the Federal Institute of Science and Technology of SÃ£o Paulo, Campus Piracicaba), in 2019, the whole project almost had zero cost, was maily built with parts of trhown-away printers and a Arduino with analogic controllers, drives and power-source, was highly praised by the faculty teachers because was the first work of conclusion (in the mechanical area) that had Microcontrollers, a work fully integrated to the Automation Technician Course (that i've concluded in 2016), it's a mini overhead crane designed to support 1KG.


i've lost the videos and the written work, that's only the code
